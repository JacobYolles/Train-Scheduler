# Train-Scheduler


This project consists of my creation of a series of list items that will track where a train is based off of and where it will go to and when it will arrive there! The user will put in the name of the train, the destination, the start time of the train to run, what it's frequency is. The form will then spit out that data, AND when the next arrival is and how many minutes that is, using some clever behind the scenes javascript math! This project is also notable for instituting data storage and giving it back on and from firebase.
